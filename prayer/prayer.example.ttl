O Holy Spirit, descend plentifully into my heart.
Enlighten the dark corners of this neglected dwelling and scatter there Your cheerful beams.
Breathe in me, O Holy Spirit, that my thoughts may all be holy.
Act in me, O Holy Spirit, that my work, too, may be holy.
Draw my heart, O Holy Spirit, that I love but what is holy.
Strengthen me, O Holy Spirit, to defend all that is holy.
Guard me, then, O Holy Spirit, that I always may be holy.

    prayer:content """
You who are unchangeable, whom nothing changes!
You who are unchangeable in love, precisely for our welfare,
not submitting to any change:
may we too will our welfare,
submitting ourselves to the discipline of Your unchangeableness,
so that we may in unconditional obedience find our rest
and remain at rest in Your unchangeableness.

You are not like us;
if we are to preserve only some degree of constancy,
we must not permit ourselves too much to be moved,
nor by too many things.

You on the contrary are moved,
and moved in infinite love, by all things.
Even that which we humans beings call an insignificant trifle, and pass by unmoved,
the need of a sparrow, even this moved You;
and what we so often scarcely notice,
a human sigh, this moves You,
You who are unchangeable!

You who in infinite love is moved,
may this our prayer also move You to add Your blessing,
in order that there may be brought about such a change in us who pray
as to bring us into conformity with Your unchangeable will,
You who are unchangeable!
